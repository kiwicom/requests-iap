class IAPAuth(requests.auth.AuthBase):
    """Custom requests Auth class used to authenticate HTTP requests to OIDC-authenticated resources using a service account.

        The major use case is to use this flow to make requests to resources behind an Identity-Aware Proxy (https://cloud.google.com/iap).
        This works by generating a JWT with an additional `target_audience` claim set to the OAuth2 client id which
        is signed using the GCP service account credentials.

        This JWT is then exchanged for a Google-signed OIDC token for the client id specified in the JWT claims.
        Authenticated requests are made by setting the token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

        This token has roughly a 1-hour expiration and is renewed transparently by this authentication class.
        The renewal interval is 30 minutes (to keep requests working with the old token for roughly 30 more minutes in case Google API is down).
        This can be configured via the `jwt_soft_expiration` parameter.
